# testBluetoohPrinter
Project to test bluetooth pos/esc printer using react-native-bluetooth-escpos-printer, and printing a view using react-native-bluetooth-escpos-printer

I forked react-native-bluetooth-escpos-printer and add beep sound when useing POS/ESC print with android.

That project was tested with a Thermal Printer BT-58 using encoding CP_860, by this way the printer will print special characters from PT_BR.

Is possible to print directly and creating a image from a React Native View using "react-native-view-shot".
